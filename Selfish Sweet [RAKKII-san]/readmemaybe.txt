Cranberry City.

Not a whole lot of stuff happens in this suburb, or at least what I know of.
I moved here because it was closer to my college campus, but I had to leave my friends, my mom, and familiar places behind.
I'm sitting in my bedroom all alone, bored out of my mind (well, I'm not COMPLETELY alone, Cannonball is also stuck with me lol)
Whatever, I need a break from all my schoolwork and ennui.
Cannonball has been bugging me to get out of the house for a while.
Maybe I'll breathe some fresh air and see whatever's in this Ocean Spray ass town.
Hmmm, there's a candy shop a 10 minute walk from here, I wonder what's in store......
